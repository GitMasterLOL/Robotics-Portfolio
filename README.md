## 2. Portable Oscilloscope PCB
🔗 Repo: [PocketScope](https://github.com/GitMasterLOL/PocketScope)

**Project overview:**
Design of a compact, low-cost oscilloscope intended for learning mixed-signal circuit design, signal conditioning, and noise management in embedded measurement systems.

**My contributions:**
- Designed multiple PCB revisions focusing on analog front-end layout, power integrity, and ADC signal routing
- Implemented input scaling to measure higher-voltage signals using low-voltage microcontroller ADCs
- Iterated on board layout to reduce noise, ground bounce, and coupling between digital and analog sections

**Key skills demonstrated:**
PCB design, mixed-signal electronics, schematic capture, hardware debugging mindset

**Pending work:**
Housing design, Communication system, GUI design for signal visualization

🔗 Repo: [Motor Driver Enclosure](https://github.com/GitMasterLOL/Motor-Driver-enclosure)

**Project overview:**
Mechanical design of a compact motor driver enclosure incorporating magnetic holders and forced-air cooling to improve thermal performance and reliability in high-current unstable operation.

**My contributions:**
- Designed a 3D CAD enclosure optimized for stability, airflow, component accessibility, and mounting constraints
- Integrated a fan-based cooling path
- Considered manufacturability, cable routing, and maintenance access in the
  mechanical layout

**Key skills demonstrated:**
Mechanical CAD, enclosure design, thermal considerations, practical manufacturability
